# Example 1:
Start with a blank wordle puzzle:
![blank.jpg](Documentation/blank.jpg)
Make your first guess, choosing a good start word such as `stern`.
![1guess1.jpg](Documentation/1guess.jpg)
Launch your `WordleSolver.exe` application on your computer and select the proper number of letters to load the dictionary.

Exclude the letters in grey by entering the search string like this:
![1ss1.png](Documentation/1ss1.png)
Include/exclude letters in another search string (orange letters are lowercase, green letters are uppercase):
![1ss2.png](Documentation/1ss2.png)
Press `S` in your solver, note how many possible solutions we have left.
![1ss3.png](Documentation/1ss3.png)
That's too many to accurately guess, let's try another word in the puzzle to further narrow down our solution.

Update our searchable list using the color codes (`.udi` and `a___t`). Then use the `P` option to print the list of possible solutions. Choose from this list for the next guess.

**Good work!**
